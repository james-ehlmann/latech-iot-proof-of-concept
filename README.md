# LATech IOT azure cloud secure storage proof of concept

I am sorry if you are picking up this project from a linux / mac only environment.

## Technologies employed asp.net, mssql, azure, python*

asp.net this web application is deployed via iis, and I used visual studio to make this code

mssql this web application uses mssql as the backend, ssms is what I used to connect to it

azure this web application was developed with the azure platform in mind (however this can be used in an entirely local manner in theory)

python* the test mock iot devices will be created in python, they do not exist yet.
