What I've done so far:

1. signed up for azure free trial (30 days or $200) (much trial and error, not really replicatable)
2. create azure webapp + database (for asp.net)
3. Connect an azure web app to github so that when I push my app goes there
4. Connected to the mssql database with ssms, have to remember to add firewall rule to db, 'add client ip' just werked for me.
5. create database table structure with /db/create.sql
6. run test inserts just to be sure /db/insert.sql

TODO
7. get api to use database (asp.net connect to and use database.)
8. secure api (with https & rest preferably)
9. build dummy client app in python for proof of concept. (pretty easy muh dude.)
